session library
===================================================================

Library provides the model for the session state and service which
manipulates it.

A session is an instance of communication between a set of people.

This needs to be fleshed out. I am thinking of doing a reference 
counted setup for the life of a session. Right now if you leave
a session, you cannot come back.
