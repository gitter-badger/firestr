network library
===================================================================

Implements code to send bits and blips over the network.
The general design is that there is a factory function which
returns a new message_queue object that implements the 
message_queue interface.

Currently only boost asio is supported at the moment.

file summary
===================================================================

message_queue       - Main interface for creating a network queue.
                      Contains the message_queue interface.

boost_asio          - TCP (and UDP) queue implemented using boost asio library. 
                      Implements the message_queue interface.

connection_manager -  Manages boost_asio TCP connections. Opens a listen
                      socket and has a socket pool for outbound connections on
                      the same port. Had a send and recieve function which
                      multiplexes and demultiplexes messages between all open
                      connections

stungun            -  Implementation of a simple STUN client to get ip and port 
                      information. Currently uses QT's UDP sockets but will soon
                      change it to use boost asio udp.
