firelocator app
===================================================================

This application is similar to a STUN service. Firestr instances
register with it and it helps them find each other across the deep
black ocean known as the internet. 

It does not broker any communication between firestr instances,
it simply lets each instance know about the others so that they
can initiate p2p communication over NAT.
