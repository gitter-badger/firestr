Firestr (Pronounced Fire Star)
===================================================================

This is not the web. Firestr in short, is a distributed, 
decentralized way to communicate and share through running programs.

You don't send a message to someone, you send an program, which 
can have rich content. All programs are wired up together automatically
providing distributed communication, either through text, images, videos, 
or games.

The source code to all applications is available immediately to 
instantly clone and modify. 

===================================================================
Organization
===================================================================

This is the reference implementation of the protocol. It uses QT for
the GUI and a custom message back-end. Currently the applications
are written in Lua, but other bindings will be provided in the future. 

The main directory is src. Each subdirectory is a library and
the main application is in src/firestr

The project uses CMake as the meta-build configuration.
