Ideas

- Two types of sessions, public and private
--public ones can be joined from the outside. 
    This is to allow a sort of persistent presence. To allow things
    like status updates and other magic. 

- When authenticating first time, encrypt authentication request using passwords. 
  For the paranoid, they can tell each other the passwords to decrypt the request and get the public key,
  in case they are worried about spoofing.
