Installing Apps
===============

Once you've installed Fire★ , you're going to want to start using apps to communicate with your friends (or enemies, we won't judge you).  A few example apps can be found on [our website](http://mempko.com/firestr/firestr.html) under the "example apps" section.  Find one you want to install (I personally enjoy [pong](http://mempko.com/firestr/pong.fab)), click on it, and download it.  Once you've downloaded it, you can either click and drag it into Fire★ to install it, or just click `Main` and then `Install App` and then select the app in your file manager.  Congratulations! You've installed your first app!
