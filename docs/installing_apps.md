Installing Apps
===============

Once you've installed Fire★ , you're going to want to start using apps to communicate with your friends (or enemies, we won't judge you). 

There are two ways to install applications

  1. Install a package you download from the web.
  2. Install a package someone used in a conversation.

From the Web
----------------

 A few example apps can be found on [our website](https://mempko.com/firestr/firestr.html) under the "example apps" section.  Find one you want to install (I personally enjoy [pong](http://mempko.com/firestr/pong.fab)), click on it, and download it.  Once you've downloaded it, you can either click and drag it into Fire★ to install it, or just click `Main` and then `Install App` and then select the app in your file manager.  Congratulations! You've installed your first app!

Used in a Conversation
----------------------

If someone uses an application in a conversation with you, you can install it with one click! Next to all applications used in a conversation there is an `Install` button on the top right by the application name.

Click on the `Install` on the top right of the application and it will be added to your collection. You can then use this application in your own conversations with others.


Editing Installed Applications
---------------------------

Any application you install you can modify. See [Creating Apps](api/index.md).
