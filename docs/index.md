Fire★
=====

Fire★ is a decentralized, peer-to-peer platform for communication and computation.  Fire★ makes it much simpler to both develop P2P applications and share these applications with others.

Features
--------

  * *Simple*: Fire★ is minimal and hackable, so you can immediately begin working on what matters

  * *Decentralized*: Fire★  is peer-to-peer, so you don't depend on any central authority for your services to work

  * *Secure*: Fire★ encrypts your connection, so the only people who see what you're working on are those you want to

    * DISCLAIMER: Fire★ is still under development and has not been fully audited.  Use at your own risk

  * *Collaborative*: Fire★ makes it easy to work with other people in real time.  Instead of emailing files back and forth or relying on a central website, build together in real time
