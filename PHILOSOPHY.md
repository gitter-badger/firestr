The Fire★ Philosophy
===================================================================

Fire★ is about burning star networks. It is the inverse of the web.
To stay true, we will follow the philosophy below.

1. All communication is owned by the users.
2. All communication is secure.
3. All Apps and components are always available for copying, modifying and sharing.
4. Work "out of the box".
5. Make writing decentralized software easier than centralized software.
6. Enable the full power of computers in the most accessible way.
8. Have Fun!
