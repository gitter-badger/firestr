Building Firestr
===================================================================

Firestr uses CMake for it's meta-build configuration.

> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake 
> make -j

===================================================================
Running Firestr
===================================================================

There are two ways to have two or more instances of Firestr connect
to each other. 

If you are on a local network and only want to communicate within 
the local network, you can simply run firestr executable in your
build directory

If you want to communicate over the internet via p2p, you have to 
first have to add a public firegreet instance to your greeter list
under the contact menu.

To connect with someone, create an invite file and give it to them in
a secure way. Also get their invite file. They can then add you as a 
contact via the invite file. After you both add each other to the contact, 
list, firestr should automatically connect you with the other person. 

The firegreet service is simply responsible for providing information
to the parties on their public ip/port after which firestr will 
initiate a p2p connection. 

Once a contact is added, they are saved as your contact and you will
connect to them the next time you start the application.

You can have multiple contacts and multiple greeters. Once you have
a contact to communicate with, you can initiate a conversation and start
chatting or sharing applications.

Have fun.
